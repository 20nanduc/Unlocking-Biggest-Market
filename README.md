# Unlocking India’s Hidden Goldmine

At first glance, the title sounds bold — maybe even exaggerated.
But give me a moment, and you’ll see why I believe this could be India’s next untapped goldmine.

## 👋 Hey there — I’m Nandu

I’m a software developer working under the central government.  
Like every developer, my brain is wired in a weird way — whenever I see a problem, my first thought isn’t *“that’s tough”* but *“can we solve it with tech?”*

Recently, a random question hit me hard:

> **Where do Indians actually spend most of their money?**

## 💡 The Thought That Sparked It

I’m from Kerala, now working in Bangalore. My colleagues come from every corner of India.  
Being a government employee means we get holidays for almost every major festival — from Pongal to Onam, from Bihu to Diwali.

One day I was scrolling through our holiday list and thought — if we celebrate every state’s festival, we’d probably need **365 holidays a year!**

Then it struck me deeper when a colleague was planning his wedding.  
He was casually talking about spending lakhs — not on property, not on investments — but on **celebration**.

That’s when the dots started to connect.

## 🎉 Celebration — India’s Real Obsession

From birth to death — literally everything in India is celebrated.  
A baby is born — celebration.  
A house is built — celebration.  
Even after someone passes away — in many cultures, that too becomes a celebration of life.

Add to that the countless birthday parties, weddings, inaugurations, farewells, and office functions — every single day, across the country, *millions of events are happening.*

We spend more on celebration than on almost anything else.  
Ambani might spended ₹1000 crore on his son's wedding — no wonder, even the common man takes loan to make sure his big day *“looks perfect.”*

So I asked myself —

> **What’s the biggest market in India that no one has fully tapped yet?**


That's india's wide celebrations

## 💻 The Developer in Me Kicked In

The first question that hit me was —  
> “Can we digitalize this massive celebration industry?”

We’ve done it before in so many areas — and every time, it changed the game.

Think about it.  
We already have **Amazon** for shopping, **Zomato** for food, **Blinkit** for groceries, **Myntra** for fashion, **PharmEasy** for medicine — the list keeps growing.

At first glance, it looks like all these platforms solved different problems.  
But here’s the truth that hit me — **they all solved the same single problem in different angle.**

> A physical shop can only hold so much.  
> A digital one can hold everything.

That’s it.  
That’s the real reason every e-commerce platform succeeded.

They didn’t reinvent what people do — they just removed the boundaries around it.  
They gave us **infinite shelves**, **24x7 access**, and **trust** that your product will reach you.  
Simple idea — massive impact.

And that’s when I realized...  
india's millions of events doesn’t have that one common clear problem yet or unknown.  
It’s scattered — full of emotions, traditions, people, chaos, and last-minute fixes.  
There’s no single *“store limit”* to break.

That’s why digital platforms in this space haven’t exploded yet.  
Because no one has found that **one universal truth to solve** — the way e-commerce or other platforms did.

## 🤔 Why India's Millions of Events Are Still Untouched?

Many have tried to digitalize events/celebrations — but somehow, it never really took off.  
Strange, isn’t it? We can order food in 10 minutes, shop for anything from our couch, even get medicines at midnight — yet when it comes to events, things still run the old-fashioned way.

Why?

It’s not that people didn’t try hard enough.  
It’s not about lack of money, ideas, or technology either. People trying create a general template for organizing events without knowing real problem.

The truth lies somewhere deeper — hidden in how we celebrate, how we trust, and how every event feels… different from other.

Events are not like buying a product; they’re alive — filled with **emotions**, **people**, **chaos**, **last-minute miracles**, and **memories** that can’t be templated.

Maybe that’s why no one has cracked it yet.  
Because to digitalize celebrations, you don’t just need code — you need to understand **people.**

And that’s what I’m trying to explore, step by step.

## 🚀 What’s Next

I’m not claiming to have all the answers.  
I’m just exploring this idea like a curious engineer — someone who believes there’s a smarter, more meaningful way to build the next big brand of **celebrations in India.**

Think about it — celebrations are the heartbeat of this country.  
Every color, every song, every ritual tells a story.  
Yet, the way we manage them hasn’t evolved much in decades.

We digitized shopping. We revolutionized delivery.  
But celebrations? They’re still waiting for their moment.

Maybe the next big revolution in India won’t be about **speed**, **discounts**, or **convenience** — but about how beautifully we can bring people together.

If you’ve ever looked at a chaotic wedding, a sleepless event planner, or an over-budget party and thought *“this could be done better”* — then you already sense what I’m chasing.

Let’s build something that doesn’t just **work** — something that **feels right.**  
Something people **remember.**
